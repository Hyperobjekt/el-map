[8h] Selected location outlines are not accurate bug (#14)
https://github.com/Hyperobjekt/el-map/issues/14

"region is not available at this zoom level" appears too early

<!-- clicking some block groups (tracts?) doesn't produce a "center", fails
because center isn't visualized... fix: don't require center -->

Legend min/max off, scale 0-1%?
update block group extents

if you change to modeled with < county level geos, close them
  
utah not adding feature through search

<!-- fix footer overflow scroll -->

fix locations missing from params

!!!replace pointInBox with GEOID or pointInPolygon!!!

ETL:
- rerun for display names
- add low flags
- redo extents (missing 2017-2018 block group values)
- add NESW to states
...
- bgs
- modeled data




FLAGGED:
- MD and NOLA for certain metrics
- geographies flagged low_flag
  - ETL tags states,counties,cities,tracts,bgs based on client-provided csvs
- values in top 1% based on client-provided 99-percentile.json


CONFIRM:

_FLAGS_
- will turn red if top 1%?
- only raw... even for NOLA, MD, 1%
