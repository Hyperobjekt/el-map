# Contributing to EL 2.0 Map

This app uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for front end tooling. To start the development
environment:

- clone this repo
- run `yarn install`
- run `yarn dev`

## Terminology

The following terms are used within this app:

- **Data Mode**: The term data mode refers to one of two data views within the app, modeled data and
  raw data.
- **Modeled Data**: This is the default dataset (or data mode). It contains "Eviction Filings" and
  "Households Threatened" data metrics for States and Counties that are based on mathematical
  models.
- **Raw Data Mode**: This is the secondary dataset (or data mode). It contains "Eviction Filings",
  "Eviction Judgments", and "Households Threatened" data metrics for States, Counties, Cities,
  Tracts, and Block Groups. _Note that the "raw" data is now communicated to users as "proprietary"
  data._
- **Context**: Context within the app often refers to the current user selections in the app,
  including the current metric ID(s), region, and year.

## Practices

### Styling

- re-usable base component styles like buttons, typography, select menus, etc. should be styled in
  the theme file (`src/theme`) so they display consistently across the app.
  - see [theme.js](https://github.com/Hyperobjekt/el-map/blob/development/src/theme.js) for example
    of style overrides
- components requiring minor style adjustments can be styled using the
  [`sx` prop](https://mui.com/system/the-sx-prop/). this is not advised if there are several style
  adjustments required to prevent polluting the JSX with props. see the below option for these
  cases.
- components needing a higher degree of customization should use a separare `{{component}}.style.js`
  file. The file should contain a root element and child element styles via class name, following
  [BEM naming conventions](http://getbem.com/naming/).
  - see
    [MapLegend.jsx](https://github.com/Hyperobjekt/el-map/blob/development/src/Map/components/MapLegend.jsx)
    and
    [MapLegend.style.js](https://github.com/Hyperobjekt/el-map/blob/development/src/Map/components/MapLegend.style.js)
    for an example.

## App Configuration

The app uses @hyperobjekt/react-dashboard to handle configuration. You pass it some configuration
JSON and it provides some hooks to help you build the app.

There are a few configuration JSON files in `src/Config`:

- `base.json`: this is the configuration that is common between "raw" and "modeled" data. It
  contains app-wide settings and default options as well as language configuration.
- `modeled.json`: this is the configuration for metrics, map sources, map layers, and data scales
  within the modeled data mode.
- `raw.json`: this is the configuration for metrics, map sources, map layers, and data scales within
  the raw data mode.

### App Data

All data for the app is managed through static assets, which include (note that the assets stored in
https://s3.amazonaws.com/eviction-lab-tool-data/data/ get served at https://evictionlab.org/data):

- Vector tilesets
  - Tilesets are generated via [ETL repo](https://github.com/EvictionLab/map-v2-etl) and hosted on
    S3 with CloudFront (and served at https://tiles.evictionlab.org/v2/).
  - Data is split between tilesets for optimization. Each region is split into two tilesets, one for
    2000-2009 data and one for 2010-2019 data. Total of 14 tilesets (5 raw regions + 2 modeled
    regions).
  - Each data point is represented by the metric id followed by a hyphen and the two digit year for
    the value (e.g. `ef-01` for eviction filings in 2001)
- Static CSV files
  - one file each for raw and modeled national data for line chart and national average comparisons
    ([raw-national.csv](https://s3.amazonaws.com/eviction-lab-tool-data/data/v2/national-averages/us_proprietary_2000_2018.csv),
    [modeled-national.csv](https://s3.amazonaws.com/eviction-lab-tool-data/data/v2/national-averages/national_modeled.csv))
  - one file for each region for each dataset that contains metadata for each metric (min, max,
    lowest 1% value, top 99% value). these values are used to determine the low / high end of the
    scale and also to flag potential outliers. (example:
    [counties-extents.csv](https://evictionlab.org/data/v2/extents/raw/counties-extents.csv))
  - a counties file containing metadata needed for search
    ([counties.csv](https://s3.amazonaws.com/eviction-lab-tool-data/data/search/counties.csv))
  - flag files generated by [ETL repo](https://github.com/EvictionLab/map-v2-etl) that dictate when
    users should see a "flag" (a warning to provide context for a particular data point).
    `base.json` has "flag configs" that dictate which geos and metrics are relevant for each flag.
    `base.json` also contains copy (items of format "FLAG*{flagName}*{flagValue}") indicating what
    copy should be displayed for data with a [flagName] value equal to [flagValue].
    - a file marking the 99th percentile of each metric, per geo per year. data within the scope of
      the "outliers" flag will be flagged when values exceed these 99th percentile thresholds, as
      determined in `getCutoffFlagValue`.
      ([99th-percentile.json](https://s3.amazonaws.com/eviction-lab-tool-data/data/v2/flags/99-percentile.json))
    - a file which maps dictates flag values for all "client" and "client-suppression" type flags.
      keys of the map take the form "{fips}-{yr}-{flagId}" to indicate values that should be either
      flagged or suppressed for a certain geography/year (as determined in `getClientFlagValue` and
      `getIsSuppressed`, respectively).
      ([flags2000-2018.json](https://s3.amazonaws.com/eviction-lab-tool-data/data/v2/flags/flags2000-2018.json))
    - note that there are also "geographic" flags, which don't require any static asset for
      reference; rather, they are applied to data from geographies with fips codes that match _any_
      of the `geoStart` or `geoEqual` rules specified in the flagConfig (when said data is
      "relevant", as per the `relevantYears`, `relevantMetrics` etc also specified in the
      flagConfig), as determined in `getGeoFlagValue`.

### @hyperobjekt/react-dashboard Hooks + Functions

There are several hooks provided by @hyperobjekt/react-dashboard. See the API documentation for the
specific modules for more hook usage:

- [i18n](https://github.com/Hyperobjekt/react-dashboard/blob/development/src/i18n/API.md)
<!--
  NOTE: the percent_value formatter isn't currently used because it shows 2 decimals for values < 1
    so we instead use d3-format's format('.1~f') directly (see getFormattedValues util)
  TODO: add option in react-dashboard to allow selection of this formatting option
 -->
- [Formatters](https://github.com/Hyperobjekt/react-dashboard/blob/development/src/Formatters/API.md)
- [Locations](https://github.com/Hyperobjekt/react-dashboard/blob/development/src/Locations/API.md)
- [Router](https://github.com/Hyperobjekt/react-dashboard/blob/development/src/Router/API.md)
- [hooks](https://github.com/Hyperobjekt/react-dashboard/tree/development/src/hooks)

The most common you will use include:

#### [useLang()](https://github.com/Hyperobjekt/react-dashboard/blob/development/src/i18n/API.md#uselangkeys-context--string--arraystring)

Retrieves a single key or multiple keys from the language config (`base.json`). Any values passed as
a secondary argument will be interpolated into the string.

```jsx
import { useLang } from '@hyperobjekt/react-dashboard';

// LANGUAGE CONFIG:
// {
//   "MY_STRING": "My string",
//   "FIRST_LABEL": "First label",
//   "SECOND_LABEL": "Second Label",
//   "DYNAMIC_STRING": "Hello {{value}}!"
// }

const MyComponent = () => {
  const myString = useLang('MY_STRING'); // "My string"
  const multipleStrings = useLang('FIRST_LABEL', 'SECOND_LABEL'); // ["First label", "Second Label"]
  const dynamicString = useLang('DYNAMIC_STRING', { value: 'world' }); // hello world!
};
```

#### `useBubbleContext()` / `useChoroplethContext()`

These hooks retrieve current selections in the app. The context is passed to additional hooks like
`useAccessor`, `useChoroplethScale`, and `useBubbleScale`.

```jsx
import { useBubbleContext, useChoroplethContext } from '@hyperobjekt/react-dashboard';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const bubbleContext = useBubbleContext();
  // bubbleContext = { metric_id: "er", region_id: "counties", year: "2016" }
  const choroplethContext = useBubbleContext();
  // bubbleContext = { metric_id: "p", region_id: "counties", year: "2016" }
};
```

#### `useAccessor()`

Provides a function that takes a context and returns a variable name that reflects the given
context.

```jsx
import { useAccessor } from '@hyperobjekt/react-dashboard';
const MyComponent = () => {
  const accessor = useAccessor();
  const varName = accessor({ metric_id: 'er', year: '2016' });
  // varName = "er-16"
};
```
